This Repo help you to manage your irrigation system.

We start with simple examples and my expectations are to grow up and realize a complete system:

* automatic
* easy to use
* customizable

### What is this repository for? ###

The project are composed by:

* Web-Service based on a Firebase Real Time DataBase (it contain all the scheduling)
* Web-App that permit to add and remove scheduling
* Arduino sketchs that help you to retrieve the scheduling and start the irrigation

The Arduino sketch are:

1. button: start the irrigation with a button plugged in the Arduino board.
2. jsonPrint: retrieve and print the Json stored on Firebase.
3. scheduling: retrieve and start the irrigation using the scheduling stored on Firebase.

### How do I get set up? ###

Start from the first example and proceed with the next.
Copy the folder into your Arduino library and start to modify and contribute to the Repo.
The understanding is easy and there are many ways to improve these sketchs.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines

### Who do I talk to? ###

I'm Paolo Giorgi and in free time I try to simplify my life.

Arduino helps me but I hope that someone else does it with his own contribute to this Repo.
